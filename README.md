## :dart: About

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
